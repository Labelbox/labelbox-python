            This function is currently experimental and has a few limitations that will be resolved in future releases
            1. If you try to add an unsupported you will get an error referring to invalid foreign keys
                - In this case `role.get_roles` is likely not getting the right ids
            2. Multiple invites can be sent for the same email. This can only be resolved in the UI for now.
                - Future releases of the SDK will support the ability to query and revoke invites to solve this problem (and/or checking on the backend)
            3. Some server side response are unclear (e.g. if the user invites themself `None` is returned which the SDK raises as a `LabelboxError` )
