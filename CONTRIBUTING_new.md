## Helpful steps
### Branches and Tags
* Begin by creating a branch off the develop branch.
* All development should occur in feature branches, ideally prefixed with the contributor's initials. For example, use `fs/feature_name` for a feature branch.
* Once a PR is approved, merge it into the develop branch using the standard GitHub _PR merge button_   s labeled Merge pull request. This action will squash all commits.
* Ensure that you review all comments thoroughly and make necessary edits or deletions before completing the merge.



### Internal Code Documentation Update

Our internal developer documentation is generated from Python docstrings and hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/labelbox-python/) using Sphinx.

Docstrings should be formatted according to the guidelines found [here](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html).

Unless you're adding a new package or file, documentation updates are automated. You can review your updated documentation by running the following command at the root of the repository:
```bash
rye run docs
```

After running the command, navigate to `docs/build/html` and open the index.html file to confirm that your documentation updates are reflected:
```bash
open index.html
```

**Adding New Packages:**
If you add a new package, you must update the Sphinx configuration:
* Add the new package to docs/labelbox/index.rst.
* Create a new .rst file for the new package.

Re-run the documentation command to generate the updated docs and verify your changes.
